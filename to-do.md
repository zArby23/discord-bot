# To do list!
### Welcome to my to-do list, where I put the changes or tasks I need to do in order to progress in my self-studies of Discord.js and Node.js!

**1.** ~~(Fix the error when using a slash command.)~~ > ***Done!***

**2.** Add more commands. _(In proccess)_

**3.** Explore the documentation of "discord.js"

**4.** See the tutorials for Node.js

**5.** ~~(Fix the error where the application does not respond when using "/info" slash command.)~~ > ***Fixed!***

**6.** ~~(Make the "Click me!" button can be activated multiple times.)~~

 - 6.1 **It can be activated multiple times**, I just have to figure out how to get another message when clicked! 

**7.** ~~(Add another button and make it work.)~~ > ***Done!***

```
